Got it! I can help you draft a professional README for your backend string analyzer service built with Express, nodemon, and crypto. Here’s a clear and concise template you can use and customize:

---

# String Analyzer Service - HNGi13 Stage 1 Backend Task

## Overview

This is a RESTful API built with **Express.js** to analyze strings and store their computed properties such as length, palindrome check, unique characters, word count, SHA-256 hash, and character frequency. It supports creating, retrieving, filtering, and deleting string analyses.

---

## Features

* Analyze and store string properties:

  * Length
  * Palindrome status (case-insensitive)
  * Count of unique characters
  * Word count
  * SHA-256 hash (unique ID)
  * Character frequency map
* Endpoints to create, get, filter, and delete strings
* Supports query filtering and natural language filtering
* Validation and error handling for input and requests
* Built-in tests to verify functionality

---

## Technologies Used

* Node.js
* Express.js
* nodemon (for development auto-reloading)
* crypto (for SHA-256 hashing)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14+ recommended)
* npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/string-analyzer-service.git
   cd string-analyzer-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. The API will be running at:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Create / Analyze String

* **POST** `/strings`

* **Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "value": "string to analyze"
  }
  ```

* **Success Response (201 Created):**

  ```json
  {
    "id": "sha256_hash_value",
    "value": "string to analyze",
    "properties": {
      "length": 17,
      "is_palindrome": false,
      "unique_characters": 12,
      "word_count": 3,
      "sha256_hash": "abc123...",
      "character_frequency_map": {
        "s": 2,
        "t": 3,
        "r": 2
      }
    },
    "created_at": "2025-08-27T10:00:00Z"
  }
  ```

### 2. Get Specific String

* **GET** `/strings/{string_value}`
* **Success Response (200 OK):** Returns the analyzed string and properties.

### 3. Get All Strings with Filtering

* **GET** `/strings?is_palindrome=true&min_length=5&max_length=20&word_count=2&contains_character=a`
* **Success Response (200 OK):** List of strings matching filters.

### 4. Natural Language Filtering

* **GET** `/strings/filter-by-natural-language?query=all%20single%20word%20palindromic%20strings`
* **Success Response (200 OK):** List of strings matching natural language query.

### 5. Delete String

* **DELETE** `/strings/{string_value}`
* **Success Response (204 No Content):** String deleted successfully.
